# 555 Timer Monostable Multivibrator
### 1. AIM
Generate a waveform with pulse width of 0.5ms under different trigger conditions using 555 timer IC 

### 2. THEORY
The NE555 timer is a versatile IC used in a variety of timing applications. It can be operate in three primary modes:       
- **Astable Mode**: No stable state; the timer continuously switches between HIGH and LOW, producing a square wave.
- **Monostable Mode**: One stable state (LOW); the timer produces a single output pulse in response to an external trigger.
- **Bistable Mode**: Two stable states, toggled by external signals.
In the monostable mode, when a **falling edge** is applied to the **Trig** pin, the output goes HIGH for a period defined by external resistor (R) and capacitor (C), then automatically returns to LOW.

The output pulse duration (T) is given by the formula:

*T = 1.1 x R x C*

Where:
- R = Resistance in ohms
- C = Capacitance in farads
