# LTSpice simulation of a CMOS circuit #2
### 1. INTRODUCTION
In this experiment, a CMOS-based circuit is simulated using LTSpice to analyze its DC operating point, transient response and AC characteristics. The circuit consists of NMOS, PMOS and two voltage sources. The DC analysis helps to determine the biasing conditions, the transient analysis observe tge circuit's time-domain response and the AC analysis evaluates its frequency-dependent behaviour. This simulation provides insight into the circuit's functionality, whether it acts as an amplifier, switch or filter.
