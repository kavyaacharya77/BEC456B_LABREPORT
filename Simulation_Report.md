# Design and Analysis of Fully Differential Folded Cascode OTA Circuit using 180nm Technology
### 1. ABSTRACT
This paper presents the simulation and analysis of a fully differential folded cascode amplifier using 180nm CMOS technology. The design focuses on achieving high gain and improved bandwidth. Using LTSpice, the amplifier's frequency response was evaluated. Results show a mid-band gain of approximately 37 dB and a −3 dB bandwidth near 1 11.58 kHz, demonstrating the amplifier’s suitability for high gain, moderate-bandwidth analog applications.

### 2.INTRODUCTION
Differential amplifiers are fundamental building blocks in 
analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits, widely used in 
operational amplifiers, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), 
and communication systems. Their inherent ability to reject 
common-mode signals and noise makes them essential for 
high-precision and low-noise applications. To enhance the 
performance 
A fully differential architecture of folded cascade OTA 
effectively separates the signal and biasing paths, 
minimizing voltage headroom limitations and improving 
overall frequency response. Implemented in 180nm CMOS 
technology, the folded cascode OTA demonstrates superior 
performance in terms of gain-bandwidth product and power 
efficiency, making it ideal for high-speed and low-power 
analog applications. 
III. SIMULATION RESULTS 
This simulations for the folded cascode OTA structure is 
carried out in LTSpice environment using 180nm CMOS 
technology. Fig. 2 shows simulated folded cascade OTA 
circuit diagram and  Fig. 3 shows the simulated results for 
the gain and phase. 
of 
differential 
amplifiers, 
cascode 
configurations are often employed. The cascode structure 
combines a common-source stage with a  common-gate stage 
to significantly increase output resistance and reduce 
parasitic capacitance effects such as the Miller effect. This 
leads to improved voltage gain, wider bandwidth, and better 
frequency response.
