# LTSpice simulation of a CMOS circuit 
### 1. INTRODUCTION
 In this experiment, a CMOS-based circuit is simulated using LTSpice to analyze its DC operating point, transient response, and AC characteristics. The circuit consists of a MOSFET, resistor and a volage source. The DC analysis helps to determine the biasing conditions, the transient analysis observe the circuit's time-domain response and the AC analysis evaluates its frequency-dependent behaviour. This simulation provides insight into the circuits's functionality, whether it acts as an amplifier,swtich or filter.
